<h2>Installation</h2>

```
git clone https://github.com/kinxyz/Pumpkin-Nuker
cd Pumpkin-Nuker
python script.py
```

## NOTES
- Modify the config.json file
- Upload a .png file for the server icon or else the code will break
- no proxy support so only 50 webhooks can be created, meaning only 50 channels are recommended to be created. (don't worry, the spamming is still fast)
- use mass vc command to maximize the channels
